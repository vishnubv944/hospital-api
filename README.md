## About The Project

Get the API Docs here: https://pattern-frown-fc3.notion.site/Hospital-API-Documentation-e8bd7bed332a4f409a4051631b67e082

This repository provides the backend functionality for a healthcare management system. This repository provides the source code for retrieving details of doctors and patients along with their reports. MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, is used to design and develop the backend database.

This API is designed to simplify the process of managing patient records for healthcare providers. With this backend functionality, doctors and healthcare providers can easily access patient records and reports, and efficiently manage the data.

The source code provided in this repository includes all the necessary components for building and deploying the backend functionality. A detailed documentation is also included to guide developers on how to setup and use the API effectively.
